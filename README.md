# Gatsby Fleet example

This repository contains the two Gatsby frontend examples mentioned in our blog post [title](link). They are meant as reference, and are collected in a single repository so that the examples are easier to find. 

If you would like to deploy on Platform.sh, it would be best to split the two examples up before pushing to a project, as the presence of two `.platform` directories will result in an error.
